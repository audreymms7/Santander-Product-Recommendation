## Santander Product Recommendation

The goal of this project is to take Santander Bank customer information between January 2015 and May 2016, and to design a solution to predict which financial service products they would purchase in the next month :rocket: . 

### Data Wrangling
---------------------------------------
#### Bring in the data

The dataset contains 48 variables and around 13.6 million rows of data observations. I find this dataset too large for my PC to process, and therefore decide to take a random sample of 500k rows and use it for all further exercises.

1. Categorical variables:

| Variable               	|  Defination                                             	|

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
