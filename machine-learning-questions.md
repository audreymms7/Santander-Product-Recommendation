### Machine Learning Approach
---------------------------------------

#### _How do you frame your main question as a machine learning problem? Is it a supervised or unsupervised problem? If it is supervised, is it a regression or a classification?_

The goal of this project is to help Santander build a recommendation system based on client demographic data, behavioural data and products (accounts) they currently own. It is a supervised classifation problem. To achieve this, for each account I need to predict the probability that customer will open it in the next. After scoring the products from most-likely to least-likely, I would get a list of top recommended products for each client. 



#### _What are the main features that you'll use?_
Most of the original features. I would have to do some feature engineering as well.

#### _Which machine learning technique will you use?_

Gradient Boosting Decision Tree

#### _How will you evaluate the success of your machine learning technique? What metric will you use?_
